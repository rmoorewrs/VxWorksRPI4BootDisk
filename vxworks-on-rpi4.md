## 1. Build the VxWorks VSB for RPI4
- Open Workbench 4/VxWorks 7 and create a VSB for the RPI4
	- name it something like `rpi4-vsb`
- for the BSP, select `rpi_4_xxxxxx` like this and hit `Finish`:

- Build the VSB, you shouldn't get any errors

## 2. Create, Configure and Build the VIP based on the VSB

- In Workbench, create a VxWorks Image Project (VIP)based on the above VSB
	- name it something like `rpi4-vip`
- Choose "Based on a source build project", select the previous `rpi4-vsb` and hit `Finish`
	- We'll customize in the next step

### 2.1 Configure the VIP project
- open the VIP project `Kernel Configuration` tool

#### 2.1.0 Add the Target Shell Bundle
- Select the `Bundles` Tab in the middle of the screen like this and add the `Standalone kernel Shell` bundle by right-clicking and hitting `Add`:

 - return to the `Components` Tab
 
#### 2.1.1 Set the Console Baud Rate
- hit `Ctrl-F` to search for `CONSOLE_BAUD_RATE` and set it to your desired rate
- Default is 115200

#### 2.1.2 Enable Built-in DTB mode
- In the kernel configurator tool, hit `Ctrl-F` and search for `STANDALONE_DTB`
- Right-click to include the feature (`INCLUDE_STANDALONE_DTB`)
- board won't boot properly without this feature

#### 2.1.3 Configure the Network
- Search for `GENETv5` and include `DRV_END_FDT_BCM_GENETv5`
- Search for `IFCONFIG_1` and set the value string similar to this:

```
"ifname gem0","devname gem0","gateway 10.10.0.1","inet 10.10.11.27/24"

or

"ifname gem0","devname gem0","gateway dhcp","inet dhcp"
```

#### 2.1.4 Optional: add utility features like ping
Use `Ctrl-F` to search for each of these, select the feature, hit `FIND` and then right-click the feature to `Add`
- `ping (FOLDER_PING)` enables network ping
- `ifconfig (INCLUDE_IFCONFIG)` enables setting IP address
- `routec (INCLUDE_ROUTECMD)` change IP routing
- `telnet (FOLDER_TELNET)` add `INCLUDE IPTELNETS` to enable telnet server
- `DHCP client (INCLUDE_IPDHPCC)` to enable DHCP client

Note: this will add the utilities to the VxWorks C Shell. In order to add them to the bash-like CMD shell, you need to add the corresponding `IPCOM` feature. For example, to add `ping` to the CMD shell, you must select and add `INCLUDE_IPPING_CMD`


## 3. Create Boot Device and copy Files

- Format a micro SD card with FAT32 filesystem
- If you've built your own u-boot, add that along with the additional RPI4 boot files to the root directory of the micro SD Card.
	- A pre-built u-boot environment is here on GitHub: https://github.com/rmoorewrs/VxWorksRPI4BootDisk
	- clone the project and unzip the zip file to the micro SD card
```
$ git clone https://github.com/rmoorewrs/VxWorksRPI4BootDisk
$ cd VxWorksRPI4BootDisk
$ unzip vxworks-rpi4-boot-disk.zip
$ sudo cp vxworks-rpi4-boot-disk/* /mnt/location-of-your-sdcard
```

- The root directory should look something like this
```
bcm2711-rpi-4-b.dtb
config.txt
fixup4.dat
rpi-4b.dtb
start4.elf
u-boot.bin
uboot.env
```
The `config.txt` file should look something like this, in order to enable the GPIO UART:
```
# Enable mini UART
enable_uart=1
# Run in 64-bit mode
arm_64bit=1
# Use Das U-Boot
kernel=u-boot.bin
```

## Appendix:  Attach Serial Port to GPIO

- Note that Raspberry Pi GPIO pins are 3.3V
	- Connecting to 5V will damage the board 
- easiest solution is an FTDI USB RS232 cable with GND,TX, RX connections
- Recommended Cable: FTDI chipset USB/232 adapters on Amazon 
  https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07B5TP67V

Here is the Raspberry Pi GPIO Layout, we're using the 3 pins near the top right: Pin 6 (Ground), Pin 8 (UART TX) and PIN 10 (UART RX)

### FTDI USB/Serial Cable to RPI GPIO Pinout

| Function | GPIO Name | GPIO Pin | Comment                | FTDI Wire Color |
| -------- | --------- | -------- | ---------------------- | --------------- |
| GND      | Ground    | 6        | many other pin options | Black           |
| TX       | GPIO 14   | 8        | UART TX                | White           |
| RX       | GPIO 15   | 10       | UART RX                | Green           |

### Optional: Glue the Single Pin Connectors Together

![](https://github.com/rmoorewrs/VxWorksRPI4BootDisk/blob/main/attachments/vxworks-on-rpi4-1740071287468.webp)

In the photo above, I wrapped cotton thread around the 3 pin connectors and added a drop of superglue. 

***Be careful***: it's easy to ruin the connectors with too much superglue! 

***Tip:*** squirt out a drop of superglue onto a piece of wax paper, silicone mat, etc and then add tiny amounts to the thread with a toothpick.

### Optional: Tie Back the Additional Wires with Heatshrink Tubing

Since you're only using 3 of the connectors on the FTDI/USB serial cable, the extra connectors can get in the way. Rather than cut the extras off (which runs the risk shorting something) I used a piece of heatshrink tubing to hold the extra connectors out of the way. This is completely non-destructive and allows you to potentially use the other signals in the future.

## Additional Notes:
Useful tutorial on building rpi4 toolchain here (but I didn't get this one working):
https://hechao.li/2021/12/20/Boot-Raspberry-Pi-4-Using-uboot-and-Initramfs/

This tutorial was actually better, and I got u-boot up and running:
https://danmc.net/posts/raspberry-pi-4-b-u-boot/

If you use to WR Linux LTS (located here on GitHub https://github.com/WindRiverLinux24), building `u-boot` is easy.
```
$ mkdir u-boot-rpi4 && cd u-boot-rpi4
$ git clone --branch WRLINUX_10_24_LTS https://github.com/WindRiverLinux24/wrlinux-x
$ ./wrlinux-x/setup.sh --machines bcm-2xxx-rpi4 --accept-eula=yes
$ . ./environment-setup-x86_64-wrlinuxsdk-linux 	// optional, forces the build of local host tools
$ . ./oe-init-build-env [build-name-date]
$ bitbake u-boot
```

The output will be located in `<build_dir>/tmp-glibc/deploy/images/bcm-2xxx-rpi4/u-boot.bin`


### Manually Loading the uVxWorks image in u-boot:
``
```
fatload mmc 0:1 0x100000  uVxWorks
```
